## 📌 Brief About the Solution

**Objective**:  
To develop an intelligent, AI-driven system that efficiently and transparently collects, classifies, tracks, and recycles e-waste.

### 🔍 Core Components:

- ✅ **Smart Bins (IoT-Based)**  
  Internet of Things-enabled bins with sensors and image recognition to automatically detect and sort e-waste.

- 🤖 **AI + Google Gemini**  
  Uses Gemini APIs to analyze device images and classify them as:
  - Recyclable  
  - Repairable  
  - Working  

- 🔗 **Blockchain Integration (IDX)**  
  Decentralized tracking system to ensure secure and transparent traceability of each e-waste item.

- 🌐 **Circular Economy Marketplace**  
  A platform where users can sell, donate, or repair old electronics.

- 🎁 **User Incentives**  
  Users are rewarded with points, credits, or discounts for responsible e-waste disposal.

- 🌱 **Sustainability Impact**  
  Aligns with UN SDG 12: Promotes responsible consumption, reduces landfill contribution, and guarantees transparency.
